> **Prompt** In defending his view of universals, Russell maintains that universals dont inhabit the worid of sense (i.e., the world of particular objects known by sensory experience). However, he also maintains that our knowledge of at least some universals is a posteriori having a basis in our acquaintance with sense-data. In your own words, explain how these two claims might be reconciled. Then. evaluate the proposed reconciliation. Does it succeed in showing that Russel's position is consistent? why or why not? Argue for your position.

### Notes
- Russel's [[Metaphysics-of-universals\|Metaphysics-of-universals]] takes from Plato the idea that universals do not inhabit the world of sense (atemporal aspatial entities). However, his [[Knowledge-of-universals\|Knowledge-of-universals]] posits that some universals (qualities) are knowable by experience (it is a posteriori)
- *problem* = if universals are non-sensible, how can experience give us knowledge of them?
- *Russel's position* = we are acquainted with sensible particulars and through that acquaintance, we grasp the universal through the process of abstraction
- [[Russell-on-acquaintance\|Russell-on-acquaintance]] = direct relation
- recognizes [[Russell-on-acquaintance\|acquaintance]] as a primitive relation and abstraction as our way of becoming aware of the universal that acquaintance had already presented to us

**My stance / evaluation**
- if our only access to universals is through particulars, then why not just say that ww're dealing with patterns among particulars? remove universals entirely (Occam's razor argument)
- if we are being geniunely acquainted with a universal, then how can our sensory experience give us access to a non-empirical entity? univerals feel like too much as an "otherwordly entity" 
- his idea of "acquaintance" is considered as a primitve relation and is doing too much of the heavy liftting

**Arguements**
- ==The reconcilliation is consistent only if we accept acquaintance at face value as a primitive relation, at the cost of explanatory depth = asked to accept a mysterious faculty and so it is unsatisfying==
- To say that we are acquainted with, for example, “similarity” or “being to the left of” through abstraction presupposes that such universals are present to the mind in the same way that colors or shapes are.
- If acquaintance is treated as a primitive, unanalyzable relation, then abstraction can be seen as a way of navigating within the field of acquaintance, making his system internally coherent. But if we demand an explanation of _how_ abstraction delivers genuine acquaintance with universals rather than derivative concepts, the account wavers, suggesting that acquaintance is not as secure or self-explanatory as Russell assumes.

- distinguish
	- *Abstraction as concept-formation* (deriving general ideas from particulars).
	- *Abstraction as access to universals* (direct acquaintance with non-empirical entities).
- Abstraction is simply how we attend to them, not how we create them. Abstraction does not create new knowledge, it just reveals what was already there

Three arguments:
- is it simply enough to accept a primitive relation at the cost of explanatory depth
- abstraction vs acquaitance = circular reasoning
	-  if what is happening is just abstraction, then we dont need universals at all
	- how do we know what we abstract from particulars corresponds to the universal and not just a mental construct?
	- abstraction presupposes the existance of [[Russell-on-acquaintance\|acquaintance]]
- acquaitance doing the heavy lifting

### Essay
Bertrand Russell's attempt to reconcile a realist metaphysical claim of universals with an empirical epistemeology -- by insisting that some universals are known a posteriori through acquaintance with sense-data -- is consistent only if one accepts Russell's notion of acquaintance at face value, i.e. as a primitive relation. This, however, comes at cost of explanatory depth, as we are asked to accept a mysterious faculty without a clear account of how it works.

Russell endorses two claims that initially seem at odd. Ontologically, he treats, universals as real, non-spatical, non-temporal entities that do not inhabit the world of sense but are nevertheless shared by many particulars (L2, W1). Epistemologically, he asserts that knowledge of  at least some universals, (called sensible universals), is a posteriori, obtained through sensory acquaintance with particulars. He distinguishes this as knowledge by acquaintance, contrasting knowledge by description which is a priori. The tension that arises: how can experience give us knowledge of non-empirical entities that do not belong to world of sense?

Russell attempts to resolve this dilemma by claiming that when we perceive particulars (e.g. a white patch), we are directly acquainted not only with that particular but also with the universal it instantiates (e.g. whiteness). We then abstract the property from the particulars that share it (Russell, p. xxx). This forms the basis of his reconciliation between the metaphysical claim that universals are real and the epistemological claim that some are known a posteriori.

To put it simply, Russell maintains that acquaintance with a universal requires the process of abstraction. Abstraction is the mental act by which we recognize what different particulars have in common (L3, W1). Central here is Russell’s notion of acquaintance: he insists that it is not inference or construction, but a form of direct awareness. As he writes, _"Our immediate knowledge of things, which we called acquaintance, consists of two sorts, according as the things known are particulars or universals." (p. 64)_ For Russell, acquaintance functions as a primitive relation, while abstraction is our way of recognizing the universal that acquaintance has already presented to us.

However, this reconciliation only holds if we accept acquaintance entirely at face value. The moment we ask how acquaintance manages to bridge the sensible world of particulars with the non-empirical realm of universals, Russell’s explanation begins to weaken. His account ultimately depends on treating acquaintance as a primitive, unanalyzable link between subject and universal, which delivers universals to us directly alongside particulars. This secures the consistency of his position, but only at the cost of explanatory depth. Without further explanation of how acquaintance connects us to universals, this amounts to a “just so” story: acquaintance does the job because Russell tells us it does.

Futhermore, Russell himself concedes that _“among universals, there seem to be no principle by which we can decide which can be known by acquaintance.” (p. 64)_ This admission highlights the vagueness of his position. Even if we accept acquaintance as primitive, Russell offers no way to determine its scope. Why accept that we can know some universals directly, but not others? The reconcilliation is thus fragile, lacking both explanation and boundaries.

The relation between acquaintance and absraction in Russell's explanation also introduces possible circular reasoning. If acquaintance already provides us with the universal, then abstraction seems redundant. Conversely, if abstraction is what allows us to apprehend universals, then acqauitance is no longer a direct relation, which creates inconsistenties. Moreover, the two notions seem to lean on each other. Abstraction requires acquaintance, since one can only abstract properties one is already acquainted with. But acquaintance also seems to require abstraction, for without it we could not recognize the universal among particulars. Instead of yielding a clear two-step account, Russell risks collapsing the two into a single ambiguous process: acquaintance explains universals only if abstraction is presupposed, yet abstraction only works if acquaintance is already in place.

Finally, because acquaintance is primitive, indeterminate, and ambiguously tied to abstraction, it ends up doing far too much theoretical work. It is supposed to explain how we know both particulars and universals, ranging from colors and shapes to spatial relations and even logical forms. Yet it does so without a clear mechanism, principle, or boundary. Acquaintance becomes a catch-all “we just can” explanation, one that shoulders the burden of connecting us to entities outside time and space, leaving the reconcilliation at risk of looking like a placeholder.

Russell’s reconciliation does succeed in showing that his position is formally consistent, but only by appealing to acquaintance as a primitive relation. Once that notion is granted, the two claims sit together without contradiction. Yet I argue that this reconciliation ultimately fails to satisfy, because it leaves us with a mysterious faculty doing too much explanatory work, and collapses into something more like a stipulation than an account.
