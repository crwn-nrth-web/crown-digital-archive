In this lecture, Dr. Roy Casagranda examines the history and inherent biases behind the very idea of “Western civilization”. He posists that [[goverment-starts-civilization-not-writing\|goverment-starts-civilization-not-writing]] stretching the origins to Egypt and Iraq and outlines the history of western civilization through the middle ages and Renaissance.  

The central thesis that the the lecture is built on is challenging the traditional view behind western civilization's so-called dark ages. While much of Europe was politically fragmented and intellectually stagnant (as Casagrana puts it *"busy burning itself to the ground"*), Islamic societies preserved, advanced, and transmitted knowledge that Europe later drew upon during the Renaissance.

This raises a key question: was Islam “holding onto Western civilization” while Europe collasped, keeping it alive until Europe could reconstitute itself, or were the Arabs in fact always part of Western civilization? If the latter, then they weren’t saving something foreign to themselves—they were sustaining their own civilization. This builds the idea that [[western-civilization-is-a-construct\|western-civilization-is-a-construct]] rather than a historical reality.

Casagranda also points out how the [[East–West divide\|East–West divide]] is often presented as a natural fact of history, when in reality it is a product of orientalism. By framing the world in terms of “East versus West,” this narrative creates an artificial “us versus them” lens that obscures the shared, interconnected development of civilizations.
