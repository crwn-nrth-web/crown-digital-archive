Dr. Roy Casagranda comments on how historians define the start of civiliaztion with the start of writing. This is beacuse, "Historians are literary critics who do non-fiction. . . if there isn't somthing written, there is nothing for historians to talk about." Casagranda's opinion, as a political sciencist, is that *goverment starts civilization not writing*. In fact, he asserts that writing was ceated by government institutions searching for a way to keep track of inventory.

Similarly, egyptian goverments proposed calendars to help farmers keep track of seasons for crop plaanting. so, even the advent of the calender didn't start ciilization; goverment was before that.

Most historians start western civilization with the Somerians (5400 years ago), but following the premise that goverment starts civilization, the Egypts formed goverements 6400 years ago -- The Somerians beat Egypt to writing, but the Egyptians beat Somerians to goverment.
