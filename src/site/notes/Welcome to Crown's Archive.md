Hello! You can call me Crown. I’m a third-year Physics & Astronomy student with a minor in Philosophy at the University of Waterloo. This site is my digital garden — though I prefer to call it my **digital archive**. 

This is where I'll share notes, reflections, and half-formed ideas I’ve collected for the past three years. Nothing here is set in stone; these are working notes, always open to revision and expansion.

Inspired by the idea of digital gardens, this archive resists the polish of blogs and embraces the evolving, unfinished nature of thought. I’ve been keeping a private Zettelkasten in Obsidian since my first year, originally as a way to survive coursework. Over time, it grew into something bigger: a living collection of connections across physics, philosophy, history, and methods of learning. Now, I’m slowly translating that private vault into this public archive.

This archive exists in the spirit of exploration and collaboration. Entries are continually being catalogued, revised, and cross-referenced. Consider this space an invitation to browse, linger, and even join me in the margins.

## Navigation

**Current Collections:**
- #class = Most of my archive exists because of courses I’ve taken during my undergrad. Catalogues have this tag, and this is a good place to start if you want to trace my studies.
- #philosophy = From metaphysics to philosophy of mind, these pages range from reading notes to half-baked arguments.
- #physics = pages from lectures, textbooks, or just personal curiousity about the physical world
- #cosmology = A subset of physics pages, but big enough to deserve its own tag. Here’s where I put thoughts on the large-scale structure of the universe, dark matter, and other cosmic puzzles.
- #history/classics = pages on antiquity, especially Greek history and literature (Homer makes several appearences)
- #workflow = pages dedicated to how I organize this archive, and commentaries on learning tools

#### Disclaimer 
This is very much a work in progress; in fact, no matter how much I add to this diital archive, it will never be complete. Most of these notes are collections of thoughts from what I've read, heard, and learnt throughout my undergrad. I am no way close to being an expert on anything I'm writing about it. I am simply a fledging academic that hopes to find a community. Thus, if you see any mistakes here, don't hesitate to point them out. Though, in all honesty, you will see typos and grammatial errors, and all I can say abot that is: whoops.
